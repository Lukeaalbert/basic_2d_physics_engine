# basic 2d physics engine

I built this 2d physics engine which simulates gravity and the collision of particles with the help of the SFML library, which takes care of kinematics. The main.cpp provides sample execution and renders balls being "shot" from a point inside a container (see demo video).

This was so fun to build and it allowed me use (and visualize) many mathematic topics I've learned, such as verlet integration, normal and tangent vectors, and much more.
