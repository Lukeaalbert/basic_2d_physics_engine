# basic 2d physics engine

This repo contains a 2d physics engine that simulates gravity and the collision of particles. It uses SFML to render visuals and help with kinematics. The main.cpp provides sample execution and renders balls being "shot" from a point inside a container (see demo video).

This was so fun to build and it allowed me use (and visualize) many mathematic topics I've learned, such as verlet integration, normal and tangent vectors, and much more.
