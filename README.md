# Basic 2D Physics Engine

This repository contains a simple yet powerful 2D physics engine built from scratch, simulating gravity and particle collisions. It utilizes **SFML** for rendering, providing visuals of the physics in action.

## Visualization

The physics engine supports rendering visual elements to observe real-time interactions. The demo video showcases objects interacting within a bounded space.

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Lukeaalbert/basic_2d_physics_engine.git
   ```
2. Install SFML if not already installed.
3. Compile the project:
   ```sh
   g++ main.cpp -o physics_engine -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```sh
   ./physics_engine
   ```
